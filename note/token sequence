#### AUTHENTICATION
- we use the token for login
- some one putting infor in mongodb, which token to user and role .

- Token login sequence
1. User that is getting from liferay
2. Liferay login , liferay writing to mongodb POST login 
3. Liferay login, create new session with a new role
3.1. Store the token as md5 too or normal?
3.2. Put the last session into the password of user
3.3. Add time to user last_updated: TIMESTAMP,
3.3. Get the session times from the sessionToken object (time + 20)
TOKEN+MD5(char from 5 to 10 of MD5 string) md5 transform
TOKEN: 994bd0ad-134c-4b5f-8ba4-c0a9fe5d03a7
MD5 of that token: 91e51[3b129]24be5d250a391f0029648e
TOken pass to sails js: 994bd0ad-134c-4b5f-8ba4-c0a9fe5d03a73b129
4. Client will receive the token
5. Client request the token to SailsJs for verify the token
5. Sails Js will test the token and the time
5.1. Sails Js will verify token as md5 code
5.2  Find the User existed & the last token or not
5.3  Validate the time of the token
5.4. When accepted return the information of session and the role
5.5. Add session from the password part and time to the session list and return to user. only the last one!
